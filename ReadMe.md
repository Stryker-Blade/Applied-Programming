# **Hello World!**

Hello world, as all programmers are aware this is a sort of tradition that when a programmer begins a new language or has a new beginning, they start with a simple program that prints the words Hello World.This is going to be the first of many programs that helps me grow my experience in both languages and concepts.



A simple program that prints out hello world, as well as a joke about how in popular fiction a simple AI grows up to dominate the world.

To signify a new beginning for me in growing my experience as a programmer.

# Brought to you by Python!

I used VScode to create the programming.

I made the program in python, which is among the first programming languages that I ever learned.
